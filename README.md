Super Mario Paint
==========
* Current Version: 1.1.0

Help would be very much appreciated! If you manage to debug something, submit a pull request and I'll review it and (hopefully) merge it in.

Based off of the original Mario Paint on the SNES from 1992, MarioSequencer (2002), TrioSequencer, Mario Paint Composer 1.0 / 2.0 (Robby Mulvany, 2007-2008), and FordPrefect86's Advanced Mario Sequencer (2009). This will be a free program when completed, open to those who want to download it.
